            <p>There are many classic CSU Chico traditions carried out throughout the years, but the most notable
                include:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>The Undie Run takes place each December during finals week where students dash across campus in
                    underwear for laughs and unity.</li>
                <li>Pioneer Days, which began in 1915, was once shut down in the 1980s due to unruliness but has since
                    been reborn as a family-friendly celebration with parades, music, and local food.</li>
                <li>Chicoween, Chico's Halloween celebration, became notorious for rowdy parties by late October,
                    prompting increased police oversight and safety measures, including a city-university “cancel
                    Halloween” in 2003—though it continues today in a more controlled form.</li>

            <p>CSU Chico is one of the oldest campuses in the entire California State University system. It was founded
                in 1887 as a teacher-training school, originally called a “normal school.” Over time, it expanded into a
                full university and became the second-oldest CSU campus, carrying a rich legacy of education and growth
                for well over a century.
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>Started with just a few dozen students and 350 library books in the late 1800s.</li>
                <li>Today, it serves over 14,000 students with more than 300 academic programs.</li>

        <div class="Text_BOX">
            <p>The “Three Sisters” statues at CSU Chico, often called the “nuns,” were created in 1991 by artist Deborah
                Masters with help from students. Inspired by Anton Chekhov's play Three Sisters, the sculptures
                represent deep emotional states—appearing sad and thoughtful from the front but strong from the back.
                Though many myths have developed around them, such as hidden cameras in their eyes or haunted behavior
                at night, these are just fun campus legends with no truth behind them.</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Some students believe the statues are haunted or have cameras in their eyes—but neither is true.
                </li>
                <li>They're located near the Rose Garden and are one of the most talked-about art pieces on campus.</li>

            <p>Chico earned its reputation as a top-tier bike town—once ranked America's #1 cycling city by Bicycle
                Magazine in 1997—and hosts the exhilarating Wildflower Century, an annual springtime festival and
                fundraiser organized by Chico Velo. Each late-April weekend, thousands of riders choose from routes
                ranging from a 12-mile family-friendly spin to grueling 100- or 125-mile century and "megaflower"
                challenges, all starting and ending at the Silver Dollar Fairgrounds with fully supported rest stops,
                SAG vehicles, catered meals, a lively WildFest expo, and local beer on tap </p>
            <ul>
                <li>Varied route options — 8 distinct courses (Childflower, Mildflower, Metricflower, Flatflower,
                    Valleyflower, Wildflower 95/100, Mountainflower, Megaflower 125) cater to all abilities, with
                    elevation gains up to ~7,600' on the longest.</li>
                <li>Strong community vibe — the pre-ride WildFest features food trucks, bike skills demos, vendor tents,
                    and a beer garden, while all ride proceeds fuel Chico Velo's bike advocacy and local cycling
                    projects.</li>
