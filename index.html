                There are many classic CSU Chico traditions carried out throughout the years, but the most notiable

                        underwear for laughs and unity. </li>
                    <br>
                    <li> Pioneer Days, which began in 1915, was once shut down in the 1980s due to unruliness but has
                        since been reborn as a family-friendly celebration with parades, music, and local food </li>
                    <li>Chicoween, Chico's Halloween celebration, became notorious for rowdy parties by late October,
                        prompting increased police oversight and safety measures, including a city-university “cancel
                        Halloween” in 2003—though it continues today in a more controlled form </li>

                CSU Chico is one of the oldest campuses in the entire California State University system. It was founded
                in 1887 as a teacher-training school, originally called a “normal school.” Over time, it expanded into a
                full university and became the second-oldest CSU campus, carrying a rich legacy of education and growth
                for well over a century.

                The “Three Sisters” statues at CSU Chico, often called the “nuns,” were created in 1991 by artist
                Deborah Masters with help from students. Inspired by Anton Chekhov's play Three Sisters, the sculptures
                represent deep emotional states—appearing sad and thoughtful from the front but strong from the back.
                Though many myths have developed around them, such as hidden cameras in their eyes or haunted behavior
                at night, these are just fun campus legends with no truth behind them.

                Chico earned its reputation as a top-tier bike town—once ranked America's #1 cycling city by Bicycle
                Magazine in 1997—and hosts the exhilarating Wildflower Century, an annual springtime festival and
                fundraiser organized by Chico Velo. Each late-April weekend, thousands of riders choose from routes
                ranging from a 12-mile family-friendly spin to grueling 100- or 125-mile century and "megaflower"
                challenges, all starting and ending at the Silver Dollar Fairgrounds with fully supported rest stops,
                SAG vehicles, catered meals, a lively WildFest expo, and local beer on tap
