                The “Three Sisters” statues at CSU Chico, often called the “nuns,” were created in 1991 by artist
                Deborah Masters with help from students. Inspired by Anton Chekhov's play Three Sisters, the sculptures
                represent deep emotional states—appearing sad and thoughtful from the front but strong from the back.
                Though many myths have developed around them, such as hidden cameras in their eyes or haunted behavior
                at night, these are just fun campus legends with no truth behind them.

                Chico earned its reputation as a top-tier bike town—once ranked America's #1 cycling city by Bicycle
                Magazine in 1997—and hosts the exhilarating Wildflower Century, an annual springtime festival and
                fundraiser organized by Chico Velo. Each late-April weekend, thousands of riders choose from routes
                ranging from a 12-mile family-friendly spin to grueling 100- or 125-mile century and "megaflower"
                challenges, all starting and ending at the Silver Dollar Fairgrounds with fully supported rest stops,
                SAG vehicles, catered meals, a lively WildFest expo, and local beer on tap

                        elevation gains up to ~7,600' on the longest

                        tents, and a beer garden, while all ride proceeds fuel Chico Velo's bike advocacy and local
                        cycling projects
