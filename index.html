                The “Three Sisters” statues at CSU Chico, often called the “nuns,” were created in 1991 by artist
                Deborah Masters with help from students. Inspired by Anton Chekhov's play Three Sisters, the sculptures
                represent deep emotional states—appearing sad and thoughtful from the front but strong from the back.
                Though many myths have developed around them, such as hidden cameras in their eyes or haunted behavior
                at night, these are just fun campus legends with no truth behind them.
